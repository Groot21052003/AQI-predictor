# AQI-predictor
machine learning project
I have built a linear regression model which is trained by a dataset of previous 5 years AQI values of Indian cities along with pollutant concentrations.
It will provide accurate predicted value of AQI by giving concentrations inputs.
And we are currently working on forecasting project also which predicts the next 7 days AQI values. This site is not taking that much large file to upload the demo of forecasting..
